1. Allow the ability to see build status (failed or succeded) for a tag
2. DRY trtllm-serve for --tag and --show-config of tags or whatever
3. have trtllm-serve actually use the config to populate key arguments
4. Create readme
Can do 3 now since we are saving build-config correctly
Try doing nemotron for fun
